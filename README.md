**RAG02H** is a hands-on Python project focused on implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using open-source tools. This repository is designed for data scientists to build, improve, and extend RAG pipelines with a practical focus on document retrieval and answering questions using vector databases and large language models (LLMs).

**Contributors**: Riccardo Crupi, Giulia Genta, Paolo Racca, Rubini Stella.

## Project Overview

This repository contains two main pipelines:

### 1. Document Parsing and Storage Pipeline
This pipeline handles the ingestion and processing of documents, transforming them into embeddings, which are then stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval.

- **Document Ingestion**: The system reads documents from local files (e.g., PDF, DOCX, HTML) or a web URL.
- **Document Parsing**: The content of these documents is parsed and divided into chunks for better embedding generation.
- **Embedding Generation**: Each chunk of text is converted into a vector embedding using an open-source model like `sentence-transformers`.
- **Vector Database Storage**: The embeddings are stored in a vector database (e.g., Qdrant) for fast similarity search.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline
The RAG pipeline handles question answering by embedding the user's query, retrieving relevant document chunks, and using an LLM to generate a final answer.

- **User Query**: The user submits a question to the system.
- **Query Embedding**: The question is transformed into a vector embedding using the same model as used for documents.
- **Nearest Neighbors Search**: The vector database retrieves the top relevant document chunks based on cosine similarity to the query embedding.
- **LLM Generation**: The question and the retrieved chunks are fed into an open-source LLM (e.g., `GPT-4` or `LLAMA3.1`) to generate a comprehensive, context-aware answer.

NB: this RAG pipeline also supports pre-retrieval query rewriting, leveraging the same LLM technology above. This can be enabled from `src\config\config.yaml`, setting `RAG.QUERY_REWRITING` to `True`. 

### High-Level Pipeline Flow
1. **Document Parsing Pipeline**:
    - Read document → Parse content → Chunk text → Generate embeddings → Save to vector database.
    
2. **RAG Pipeline**:
    - User query → Query embedding → Retrieve relevant document chunks → Query + chunks fed to LLM → Generate final answer.

## Configuration and Setup

To configure the repository for RAG02H, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ (e.g., 3.9.7 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/)
- Recommended package manager: `pip` or `conda`
- Access to an LLM API (for generation, e.g., AwanLLM, OpenAI, HuggingFace Transformers)

### Required Libraries
Install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Vector Database Configuration

### Using Qdrant:
- Install Qdrant as specified in the requirements.txt

### Using FAISS [not implemented end-to-end]:
- No additional setup is required for FAISS. Simply ensure that the `faiss-cpu` package is installed as part of the project dependencies.

# LLM API Configuration

To generate answers using a Large Language Model (LLM), you'll need to configure your OpenAI or HuggingFace API keys.

### AWANLLM API:
1. Set your AWAN API (https://www.awanllm.com/) key as an environment variable:

    In bash:

    ```bash
    export AWAN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    ```
    In Powershell:

    ```powershell
    $env:AWAN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    ```

2. Alternatively, you can store the API key in a `.env` (see `RAG02H\.env`) file for easy loading. This is the most convenient option for VS Code users.

# Running the Project

### General Notes

Please keep the following in mind throughout the following steps.
- Ensure that you are using Python 3.9+ and that all libraries and dependendencies are installed (see above).
- Commands need to be run from the root directory (`RAG02H`).
- Ensure that `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is set. In particular:
    - if you want to run a script from (Powershell) terminal, you need to set the env variable like this
        ```powershell
        $env:PYTHONPATH="./src"
        ```
        for Linux or Max
        ```powershell
        export PYTHONPATH=/src
        ```
        before running your script as
        
        ```powershell
        python path/to/script.py
        ```
        for Linux or Max
        ```powershell
        python path\to\script.py
        ```

        or as 

        ```powershell
        streamlit run path/to/app.py
        ```
        for Linux or Max
        ```powershell
        streamlit run path\to\app.py
        ```
    - if you want to use debug/run features of your IDE, just check that the run/debug configurations of the .py script include the setting of this env variable. If you use VS Code, you already have the debug configuration ready to use in `./vscode/launch.json`.
- if you run code that sends requests to AWAN API, make sure that you have set your API key `AWAN_API_KEY` in the .env file. Never git push your api key!


### Step 1: Parse Documents
To load, parse and save the documents in the vector db, run (or debug) the following file:

```bash
.\src\ingestion\indexing_qd.py
```

This will generate embeddings from the documents and store them in the configured vector database.


### Step 2: Ask a Question
Once the documents are indexed, you can initiate the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by asking a question, run or debug the folling file:

```bash
.\src\llm\api_call.py
```

Warning: the first time SentenceTransformer: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 takes some minutes to be downloaded!

### Step 3 [optional]: Launch the Streamlit App
Start the Streamlit app to interact with the RAG pipeline (exactly the two steps before):

```bash
streamlit run .\src\ui\app_ui.py
```

Asked a question, the system will retrieve relevant document chunks and use the LLM to generate an answer based on your query.
